                        The digital era has ushered in a new technologies, giving
                        single individuals more power than ever.

                        Criminals have taken notice and are operating massive
                        scale with the highest level of anonymity ever seen.

                    <p>
                        This is achieved by encryption, a revolutionary type of
                        algorithm, first used centeries of years ago, but super
                        powered by modern processing power.

                            The FBI recovered an iPhone from a terrorist after an attack in San Bernardino, California. This phone could have contained contact information for the terrorist’s accomplices, plans for future attacks, and invaluable insight into how modern terrorists operate in the digital world. But it was encrypted, locked to everyone except those with the password. The FBI did not have the password. They needed to break the encryption. People have been breaking encryption since its creation of it with the Caesar Cipher. The only issue, it has gotten better. Much better. It could take a supercomputer hundreds of years to break the encryption on this phone. The cost of breaking the encryption would not be worth it. The FBI needed to bypass the encryption using a backdoor, so the FBI went to Apple. A backdoor is a way to get around the encryption. If encryption is a massive castle fortified from all sides, a back door is a hidden access through the sewers. Apple refused. Their backdoor was a closely guarded secret. Apple had to protect its reputation as an ultra-secure platform. Bypassing all their security, any time officials came knocking on their door wasn’t going to work. The FBI fought in court, citing the All Writs Act, but Apple rose the victor. The current regulation protected Apple. And the terrorist. The FBI had vital information at their figure tips, but the law held it back. A backdoor to bypass the encryption, required by regulation, could have made all the difference, but would have that been for the better?

                            Criminals using encryption to protect themselves from authorities is not anything new. In 2018, the FBI dismantled a Canadian-based messaging service (Phillips 2021). This secure, encrypted, messaging service aided criminals in their activities. It let them walk right beside the FBI in the digital world, without the FBI having any chance of figuring out what they were up to. This instant remote communication from anywhere in the world gave criminals superpowers. Criminals can use the infrastructure that the world has set up to wreak havoc on it. The potential anonymity given by encryption is unparalleled to any time in history.

                            Ransomware is more common than ever now. In 2020, the Finastra Group Holdings became a victim of a ransomware attack. 90 of 100 of the world’s largest banks were affected (Hastett, 2021, pg. 1). Finastra had to go dark. They were able to recover, but potential damage was clear. Attempted cyber-attacks against banks have increased from under 5,000 a week in February 2020 to more than 200,000 a week in April 2021 (Hastett, 2021, pg. 1). It was found that in a 2021 report, in the past 12 months, 44% of financial institutions paid the ransom to get their data back. Even with backups, only 47% were able to recover, despite 67% saying they could (Hastett, 2021, pg. 2).

                            The finical industry isn’t the only industry under intense pressure from ransomware attacks. The healthcare industry has seen similar trends. In a report published by the Department of Health and Human Services in 2021, it was found that in the first 5 months, 82 different ransomware attacks occurred, 72% of which exposed patient data (Kiser 2021, pg. 65). In 2016 the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center was attacked. Ambulances had to be diverted to other hospitals, records couldn’t be accessed, and certain computerized scans could not be completed (Kiser 2021, pg. 71). They were left with the decision of paying the ransom or losing access to all their patient data.

                    Prephase the simpliest solution would be not allow encryption. It would be trival to then detect an encrypted message and flag it as suspicious. However, this would come at extreme costs. Bank accounts, personal infomation, emails and more would be acciesble to anyone that wannted them. Trust would collpase.

                    Another idea rising in popularity is a backdoor for the governement. This would allow them to bypass the encryption on devices to gain access to data while still allowing for strong encryption. In theory, this solution gives the best of both worlds. Consumers still get protection against digital criminals and the government could still get the data they need. However, it’s pratically impossible to allow just the governement to access it.

                            The technical experts have warned us that it is impossible to intentionally introduce flaws into secure products, often called backdoors, that only law enforcement can exploit to the exclusion of terrorists and cyber criminals. The tech companies have warned us that it would cost millions of dollars to implement and replace them at a competitive disadvantage around the world. The national security experts have warned us that terrorists and other criminals will simply resort to other tools entirely outside the reach of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

                    Fight fire with fire. Instead of weaking encryption, it could be used as it’s fullest potential against itself. Sure, criminals could still message eachother, but robbing a bank that ultizes encryption and other digital secrity methods to their fullest potential isn’t going to be easy. Encryption might be a criminal’s best weapon, but it’s everyone else’s best defense.

                    Encryption is what keeps bank accounts secure. It’s what keeps electric grids online and planes from crashing in the sky. It lets a dad send money back to his family without worry that it will get stolen and it’s what keeps anyone from talking through baby monitors to young kids. For as much as it benefits criminals, it benefits the consumer more. Those are benefits that the consumer loses when encryption is weakened or backdoors are added, not the criminal. For every single terrorist iPhone, thousands or millions of consumer iPhones are protected by those same standards. When faced with an isolated situation, it’s intuitive to choose the best option at the present. It’s the opposite that what gives encryption its strength. Weakening a link in a chain weakens the entire chain. The same is true with encryption.
